This mod project was forked from lynxdeer
original repository: <cj>https://github.com/Lynxdeer/AutoDeafen</cj>

This was re-designed to work on Linux systems running the Game through Proton.
The way this works, is by sending a signal from your game to Discord directly.
A Vencord plugin is needed to make this work. You can get the plugin from my Github.
