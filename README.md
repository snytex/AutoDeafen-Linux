## AutoDeafen-Linux

This repository is forked from https://github.com/Lynxdeer/AutoDeafen
It was made to work on Linux systems, which can't use discord hotkeys since they run through Proton in a sandboxed environment.

### Installation

- You need to [Build Vencord from source](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) to use the AutoDeafen plugin (This will not work without Vencord!)
- Once you got that, enable the newly added plugin and restart your Discord client
- You obviously need the [Geode Modloader](https://geode-sdk.org/) 
- After you got all that done, manually install the geode mod by placing it into the mods directory

That should be it and you can now use the Auto-Deafen feature on Linux!

### Notes

I will not upload this to the official Geode store, as I don't think it would get approved since this requires usage of a third-party plugin as well.

If you still come across any issues while installing, please dm @snytexx on Discord.
